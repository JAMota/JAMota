## Projects
### Queueing theory for analysis and improvement of data pipelines

[Master Thesis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9gErQ9AE5jT2DZLjXBIdA](https://github.com/JAMota/Applied-Data-Science-and-Statistics/tree/main/Thesis)
- For my master thesis I have developed a simple data pipeline from scratch to analyze using queueing theory where I
utilized an SQLite database to store all the generated data.
- I have created a multi-step data pipeline with Apache Kafka, in Azure cloud, where I script the data generation based
on the data collection at each of the servers using python scripting.
- Following an the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) practice, I have extracted, wrangled, normalized and cleaned all the
data from each of the steps of queue, appropriately handled outliers.
- Developed a queueing theory model for this analysis, to identify and interpret the trends and patterns of the data
pipeline with the goal of optimizing the identified bottlenecks and boost performance.
